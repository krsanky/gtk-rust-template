    - Desktop: the application launcher;
    - Icons: this repo contains two icons a normal & monochromatic icon (symbolic) per the GNOME HIG, exported using [Icon Preview](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.IconPreview).
- Two Flatpak manifests: a stable & nightly one
- Dual installation support
- Uses Meson for building the application
- Bundles the UI files & the CSS using gresources
- A pre-commit hook to run rustfmt on your code
- Tests to validate your Appdata & Desktop files
- Gsettings to store the window state, more settings could be added
